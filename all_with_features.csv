The GIZ project is a regional project funded by theGerman Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) thatgives (financial and non-financial) incentives to invest remittances infriends’ and families’ micro and small businesses and thereby improve theemployment and income situation in Africa. Through the digital WIDU.africaplatform (www.widu.africa), grant applications are submitted jointly by members of the AfricanDiaspora in Germany and business start-ups and micro-entrepreneurs in Africa.Entrepreneurs are supported by improved access to finance through thetopping-up of diasporas’ transfers of funds and capacity-building ofentrepreneurial skills. After successfully piloting the project in Ghana andCameroon it is being rolled-out to Kenia (Go-live planned for Q4 2020). The project’s approach is to maximise the impact of diaspora remittances to Africa. Members of the diaspora in Germany will identify and register individuals and businesses known to them in which they trust, wish to invest and see potential. Both partners (diaspora donor andentrepreneur) apply with a joint business project. These business projects willgo through a verification process and then receive technical support from localcoaching organisations and a further financial contribution by GIZ that matchesthe joint contribution from the diaspora donor and the entrepreneur.The business projects are micro/small sized companies (start-ups as well as existing micro/small businesses) with an idea to increase revenue and in turn, employment. The project is supported and managed through the digital platform www.WIDU.africa. Via the platform the application process is managed, the project is designed, goals and budgets are set, and coaching activities are managed. The projects are monitored and evaluated through data collected directly from the beneficiaries as well as trusted coaching partners, via thedigital platform. The online platform focuses on investments ranging from EUR 250 to EUR 2,500. Theleverage ratio of the investments is 1:1:2, i.e. one Euro investment of boththe African entrepreneur and the diaspora representative is subsidized with twoEuros from the BMZ. The additional public subsidy consequently also rangesbetween EUR 250 and EUR 2,500. Accordingly, diaspora members and Africanentrepreneurs can each invest between EUR 125 and EUR 1.250.

The problem is that primary care doctors cannot offer many diagnostics in their clinics so must refer patients.
