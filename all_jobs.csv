"Project, program management",2020-09-01,2020-08-18,Fixed term,Kenya,KE,"Project Brief:The Western Indian Ocean (WIO) is not only a biodiversity hotspot, but it is also crucial to thefood security and development of the Eastern African and adjacent Island coastal states; some 60 million people are directly or indirectly dependent on fishing, tourism, and oil and gas production. However, with increasing globalisation and a rapidly growing population in the region, demand for resources is rising dramatically. The unsustainable exploitation of natural resources, urbanisation and industrialisation are a threat to the region’s vital natural coastal andmarine resources. The effects of climate change – particularly acidification of the ocean - further contributes to the decline in marine and coastal biodiversity. Since 1985, the Nairobi Convention (NC) was established as the legal framework and coordinating mechanism for regional marine protection under the aegis of the United Nations’ Regional Seas Programme (UNEP) and UNEP hosts the NC Secretariat in Nairobi. Although the contracting parties demonstrate the political will to achieve the NC goals, guaranteeing the protection and responsible use of fragile ecosystems remains a significant challenge.Effective collaboration between the relevant actors is critical to foster the necessary collective leadership for sustainable change, and this includes the full engagement of the private sector for a “blue economy”.In April 2020 the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) commissioned GIZ to implement the three-year programme in partnership with the Nairobi Convention Secretariat: Western Indian Ocean Governance Initiative (WIOGI). WIOGI’s overarching objective is that regional and national actors work together more effectively to protect and make sustainable use of marine and coastal diversity in the Western Indian Ocean.The project is designed to be participative, as well as conflict and gender-sensitive. It involves actors from different fields and is geared to regional needs.

The GIZ project is a regional project funded by theGerman Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) thatgives (financial and non-financial) incentives to invest remittances infriends’ and families’ micro and small businesses and thereby improve theemployment and income situation in Africa. Through the digital WIDU.africaplatform (www.widu.africa), grant applications are submitted jointly by members of the AfricanDiaspora in Germany and business start-ups and micro-entrepreneurs in Africa.Entrepreneurs are supported by improved access to finance through thetopping-up of diasporas’ transfers of funds and capacity-building ofentrepreneurial skills. After successfully piloting the project in Ghana andCameroon it is being rolled-out to Kenia (Go-live planned for Q4 2020). The project’s approach is to maximise the impact of diaspora remittances to Africa. Members of the diaspora in Germany will identify and register individuals and businesses known to them in which they trust, wish to invest and see potential. Both partners (diaspora donor andentrepreneur) apply with a joint business project. These business projects willgo through a verification process and then receive technical support from localcoaching organisations and a further financial contribution by GIZ that matchesthe joint contribution from the diaspora donor and the entrepreneur.The business projects are micro/small sized companies (start-ups as well as existing micro/small businesses) with an idea to increase revenue and in turn, employment. The project is supported and managed through the digital platform www.WIDU.africa. Via the platform the application process is managed, the project is designed, goals and budgets are set, and coaching activities are managed. The projects are monitored and evaluated through data collected directly from the beneficiaries as well as trusted coaching partners, via thedigital platform.

This research aims at exploitation and use of native plant beneficial microbes to increase availability of quality forage to smallholder livestock farmers in Africa by improving resilience of Brachiaria grass against multiple abiotic and biotic stresses. ",https://www.fuzu.com/assets/industries-icons/black-pngs/non_profit_social.svg.png,International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) ,,Mid-Level,,Full Time,external,Nairobi,1,36,"Microbial isolation, identification and characterization, inoculum preparation, plant inoculations, documenting agronomic and physiological performance.Conduct research to understand how naturally occurring plant beneficial microorganism(s) contribute to the drought tolerance, nutrient acquisition, disease resistance and overall performance of the host plants.Develops and apply environmental microbiology techniques to study dynamics of naturally occurring microbial communities over time.Participate in team discussions aimed at the design of new experiments, reports on results of research including publishing in peer review scientific journals, giving presentations at institutional meetings and national and international conferences.Contribute in grant writingCo-supervise research associate, research officers and visiting scientists","<div><ul style=""""><li style="""">Microbial isolation, identification and characterization, inoculum preparation, plant inoculations, documenting agronomic and physiological performance.<br></li><li style="""">Conduct research to understand how naturally occurring plant beneficial microorganism(s) contribute to the drought tolerance, nutrient acquisition, disease resistance and overall performance of the host plants.<br></li><li style="""">Develops and apply environmental microbiology techniques to study dynamics of naturally occurring microbial communities over time.<br></li><li style="""">Participate in team discussions aimed at the design of new experiments, reports on results of research including publishing in peer review scientific journals, giving presentations at institutional meetings and national and international conferences.<br></li><li style="""">Contribute in grant writing<br></li><li style="""">Co-supervise research associate, research officers and visiting scientists<br></li></ul></div><p><br></p>",,0,kes,0,kes,http://www.fuzu.com/jobs/post-doctoral-scientist-forage-microbiome-international-livestock-research-institute-ilri-be5677be-0462-48bd-82b6-8be55d140849/cf,Post Doctoral Scientist-Forage Microbiome,http://www.fuzu.com/jobs/post-doctoral-scientist-forage-microbiome-international-livestock-research-institute-ilri-be5677be-0462-48bd-82b6-8be55d140849

The problem is that primary care doctors cannot offer many diagnostics in their clinics so must refer patients. But given the infrastructure challenges in Africa (time and money it takes to get anywhere) patients often do not go.  We solve this problem by partnering with companies using robotics and AI to create lower cost diagnostics, integrating their devices into our tech platform, and sell this bundle to doctors with financing.
